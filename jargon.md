# 👽: 不要惊慌   Don't Panic!

🤓 try [jarrgon.🏴‍☠️.md]: the nerd icon is always extra reading "references", often it's unnecessary - don't click these  if you have a looming deadline!

 🍰 "c4k3" 蛋糕 is an attribution recognition and reference to a project, module, or person who made a significant contribution.  Pull requests attempting to give yourself cake is bad protocol, it's something the author, or somebodies (a plurality of) gives to a contributor.  The quasi-socialist belief is that _b00t_ would not be possible without the work of others. _b00t_'s author desires to ultimately provide metrics related to that, and if it ends up making money then I would share that generously with cake comments.  Cake  usually occurs at the point of introduction of a new technology. So if you see random 🍰 or 蛋糕 in the code, it's for attribution in teams. Make helpful Pull Requests's, get 🍰, maybe cash that in someday.  I'm sure regional edicut varies, but the project is licensed as Elastic "ELKv2" License (not related at all to ElasticDotVentures).  Cake Emoji in GitHub comments is equivalent. 

# Finally: THIS IS YOUR SPACE FOR CUSTOM SYNTAX
